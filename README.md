Which n-gonal numbers are themselves pyramids of n-gonal numbers?

This is the generalised version of the cannonball problem, which asks this question about squares and square pyramids.

This is a search algorithm, using the GNU Multi Precision library.

``irregular.csv`` contains a table of the 41 known irregular cannon ball numbers (that is, not on the form in conjecture 1.

# Build
```
g++ -O3 cannonball.cpp -o cannonball -lgmp
```

The files ``limited_cannonball.cpp`` and ``128bit.cpp`` contains slighly faster code, at the expense of being limited in integer size.

# Usage
```
./cannonball 3 10000
```
cannonball startPolygon pyramidLayerLimit

# Conjectures

For all values of ``3 | n + 1``, it appears that there is a pyramid with ``(n - 2)Â² / 3 - 2`` layers.

Conjecture 1: This holds for all ``3 | n + 1``

Cannonball numbers not of this type (currently 41) are listed in irregular.csv

Update: This was proven by Masanobu Kaneko and Katsuichi Tachibana https://www2.math.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~mkaneko/papers/kaneko-tachibana.pdf (4)

Conjecture 2: An n-gonal cannonball number must have at least sqrt(n) layers.

# Proven results

There are exactly 4 triangular canonball numbers (10, 120, 1540, 7140), and exactly 1 square canonball number (4900).
